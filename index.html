<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>
    I've been programming for over 25 years, with over a decade of work experience in Python. I also have experience
    with C, C++ , C#, Java, and many other languages. I've been a machine learning and AI enthusiast since I first
    taught myself to program at the age of 12. In the workplace, I've architected and implemented multiple predictive
    analytics pipelines, one of which was a demand forecasting system projected to save the company millions of dollars.
    At home, I spend my time working on open source projects, experimental machine learning algorithms, or my NLU
    system, <a href="https://npc.trueagi.com">NPC</a>.

<h2>Select Open-Source Projects</h2>

<h3>XCS</h3>

XCS (Accuracy-based Classifier System) is an algorithm invented by<a href="http://prediction-dynamics.com/">Stewart W.
Wilson, Ph.D.</a>. It is described in the 2001 paper, <i>An Algorithmic Description of XCS</i>, by Martin Butz
andStewart Wilson. XCS is a type of Learning Classifier System (LCS), a machine learning algorithm that utilizes a
genetic algorithm acting on a rule-based system, to solve a reinforcement learning problem. You can check out my
open-sourced implementation of the algorithm <a href="http://hosford42.github.io/xcs/">here</a>.

<h3>Pyramids Semantic Parser</h3>

The <a href="https://github.com/hosford42/pyramids">Pyramids Semantic Parser</a> is a pure-Python parser I built
for the purpose of extracting semantic information from natural language. I use it in my NLU system,
<a href="https://npc.trueagi.com">NPC</a>. It is a work in progress, but can already handle a broad cross section
of natural language inputs.

<h3>Attila</h3>

<a href="https://github.com/SaintAttila/attila">Attila</a> is a framework for automating processes with Python in
business computing environments. I implemented it during my time with Ericsson and it was used extensively to automate
ETL, reporting, and web scraping scripts, as well as an automated machine learning pipeline for generating product
demand forecasts.

<h3>Less Naive Bayes</h3>

<a href="https://github.com/hosford42/LNB">Less Naive Bayes</a> is a machine learning classification algorithm related
to Naive Bayes, but capable of handling input spaces that are not linearly separable. It works by successively training
new sub-classifiers to predict both the target classification and the mis-classifications of earlier classifiers. The
feature space is successively subdivided into linearly separable subspaces which the sub-classifiers are better capable
of distinguishing. Eventually the feature space is transformed sufficiently that the most recent layer is fully capable
of correctly classifying all samples with distinguishable features.

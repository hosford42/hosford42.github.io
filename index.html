<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>
    I'm a machine learning researcher and entrepreneur with over 30 years of focused, self-directed learning, design,
    and experimentation with novel machine learning algorithms. I was interested in algorithms before I even knew what
    one was, inventing a maze generation algorithm in 3rd grade, which allowed me to generate mazes with a guaranteed
    single solution <em>without</em> knowing what the solution was, so I could still enjoy solving them. I got my start
    with programming at the age of 12, when I discovered that my parents' 286 came with a programming manual for BASIC,
    and promptly read it front-to-back, trying out all the example code.
</p><p>
    In my mid teens, I found a book on neural networks and another on formal symbolic logic, and my undying interest in
    machine learning and AI was born. (To be clear, "AI" does <em>not</em> mean ChatGPT and other large language models.
    The field is <em>so</em> much broader than that.) I began experimenting with all sorts of ML algorithms and
    designing my own. This has continued to be my "special interest" - like a hobby, but we
    <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/about-autism/">autistics</a> do it <em>way</em>
    more intensely - for the entirety of my adult life. As a result, I developed a tremendously broad and deep
    understanding of ML algorithms. I tend to invent a new ML algorithm about once a month, on average. Many of them
    don't work, but many of them do, often better than existing algorithms, which led me to co-found a deep-tech startup
    in AI/ML. We are currently <a href="https://www.transparentai.tech/">Transparent AI</a>, but we are in the process
    of rebranding, as we have expanded in scope from novel interpretable ML algorithms to cognitive architectures as
    well.
</p><p>
    For the last ~20 years, I've also worked various computing-related day jobs, in addition to the self-driven
    projects, mostly in heavily regulated areas like banking and telco. I have helped to build a major NLP application
    serving tens of millions of customers, where I was a contributing author for a
    <a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/11977852">patent</a> in natural language processing. I've also
    architected and implemented multiple predictive analytics pipelines, one of which was a demand forecasting system
    projected to save the company millions of dollars. I found I really enjoy working with a team of engineers to solve
    hard problems in creative ways. There's an energy that fills the room when you're plotting out how to meet the
    unique challenges that stakeholders need to be addressed.

<h3>XCS</h3>

XCS (Accuracy-based Classifier System) is an algorithm invented by <a href="http://prediction-dynamics.com/">Stewart W.
Wilson, Ph.D.</a>  XCS is a type of Learning Classifier System (LCS), a machine learning algorithm that utilizes a
genetic algorithm acting on a rule-based system, to solve a reinforcement learning problem. You can check out my
open-sourced implementation of the algorithm <a href="http://hosford42.github.io/xcs/">here</a>.

<h3>Pyramids Semantic Parser</h3>

The <a href="https://github.com/hosford42/pyramids">Pyramids Semantic Parser</a> is a pure-Python parser I built
for the purpose of extracting semantic information from natural language. I use it in my NLU system,
NPC. It is a work in progress, but can already handle a broad cross section
of natural language inputs.

<h3>Less Naive Bayes</h3>

<a href="https://github.com/hosford42/LNB">Less Naive Bayes</a> is a machine learning classification algorithm related
to Naive Bayes, but capable of handling input spaces that are not linearly separable. It works by successively training
new sub-classifiers to predict both the target classification and the mis-classifications of earlier classifiers. The
feature space is successively subdivided into linearly separable subspaces which the sub-classifiers are better capable
of distinguishing. Eventually the feature space is transformed sufficiently that the most recent layer is fully capable
of correctly classifying all samples with distinguishable features.
